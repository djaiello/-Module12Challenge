# Module 12 Challenge: UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project: 
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

Explain the purpose of this analysis. 
- The purpose is well defined (2 pt)

## Results: 
The resulting filter changes now allow the user to filter the UFO sightings data on any one, or a combination of, the sighting date, city, state, country, or shape of the unidentified obect. The webpage filters can be used in the following ways:
